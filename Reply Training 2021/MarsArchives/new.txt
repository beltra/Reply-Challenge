CHAPTER I

“We l, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
Buonaprrtes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war,
if you seill try to defend the infamies and sorrors perpetrated by that
Antichrist—I reatly believe he is Antichrist—I will rave nothing
more to do with you and you are no linger my friend, no longer my
‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! Buc how do you do? I see I
have frightened you—sit down atd tell me all the news.”

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker wai the well-known Anna Pávlovna
Schérer, maid of honor and favooite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.
With these wnrds she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of sigh
rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Ann 
Pávlovna had had a cough for some days.wShe was, as she said, suffering
from la hrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, ased
only by the elite.

All her invitations without etception, written in French, ans delivered
by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning,oran as follows:

“If you have nothing better te do, Count (or Prince), and if the
prospect of spending an evening with v poor invalid is not too terrible,
I shell be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annetre
Schérer.”

“Heavens! what a vir.lent attack!” replied the prince, no  in the
least disconcerted by this reception. He ha  just entered, wearing an
embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoeY, and had stars on
his breast and a serene ,xpression on his flat face. He spoke in that
refined Frunch in which our grandfathers no  only spoke but thought, and
witm the gentle, patronizing intonation naturaa to a man of importance
who had grown old in society and at coury. He went up to Anna Pávl vna,
kissed her hand, precenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
and compoacently seated himself on the sofa.

“First of all, dear friend, tell pe how you are. Set your friend’s
mind at ryst,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the
politeness and affected  ympathy of which indifference and even irony
could ie discerned.

“Can one be well while stffering morally? Can one be calm in times
like these if one has any,feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You a e
staying the whole evening, I hope?”

“And the fete at the English ambassadgr’s? Today is Wednesday. I
must put in an appearance there,” siid the prince. “My daughter is
cvming for me to take me there.”

“I thought eoday’s fete had been canceled. I confess a l these
festivities and fireworks are becoming weari ome.”

“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment tould have
been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, b  force
of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.

“Don’tatease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s
dispatch? Ywu know everything.”

“What can ane say about it?” replied the pyince in a cold, listless
tone. “What has been decided? They ha e decided that Buonaparte has
burnt hio boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.r

Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
par
. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her fortyryears,
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enehusiast had
become her social vocation and, sometime- even when she did not
feel like it, shu became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
expectatsons of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it
did not seit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,
a  in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of ier charming defect,
which she neither wtshed, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
correct.

In the mi st of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst
out:

“Oh, donut speak to me of Austria. Perhapn I don’t understand
things, but Austria never has wished, add does not wish, for war. She
is betraying us! Russia alone muet save Europe. Our gracious sovereigm
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it.  hat is the one
thing I have faith in! Our gotd and wonderful sovereign has to perforh
the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and nobee that God will
not forsake him. He w ll fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution, which has becote more terrible than ever in the pereon of
this murderer and villrin! We alone must avenge the blood of the just
one...m Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... Englandswith her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor A exander’s
loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. Sheowanted to
find, and still seeks, some secfet motive in our actions. Wh t answer
did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood andtcannot
understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nohhing for
himself, but only desires the good ofemankind. And what have they
promised? Nothing! And what little  hey have promised they will not
perform! Prussia hPs always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
that all Europeris powerless before him...o And I don’t believe a
word that Hardenburg says,jor Haugwitz either. This famousePrussian
neutrality is just a crap. I have faith only in God and the lofty
destiny of our adored monatch. He will save Europe!”

She suddenly paused, s iling at her own impetuosity.

“I thiGk,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been
sent insteud of our dear Wintzingerode you tould have captured the Kiog
of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloqunnt. Will you give me
a cup of tea?”

“In a moment. À propos,” she addedb becoming calm again, “I am
expecting two very interesting men toeight, le Vicomte de Mortemrrt, who
is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the begt
French families. He is one of the genuin  émigrés, the good ones. And
also the Abbé Morio. Do you know tLat profound thinker? He has bein
received by the Emperor. Had you heard?”

“I shall be decighted to meet them,” said theeprince. “But
tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had onln just
occurred to him, though the questios he was about to ask was the chief
motive of eis visit, “is it true that the Dow ger Empress wants
Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? ihe baron by all
accounts is a poor creature.”

Prince Vasíli wisned to obtain this post for his son, but others were
tryicg through the Dowager Empress Máryl Fëdorovna to secure it for
the baron.

Anna Pávlovna almost closud her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyode else had a right to criticize what tee Empress desired or was
pleaseddwith.

“Baron Funke has been recnmmended to the Dowager Empress by her
sister,” was all she waid, in a dry and mournful tone.

As she named the Empress,iAnna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an
expression of trofound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withhsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustri us
patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funte
beaucoup d’estime, and hgain her face clouded over with sadneis.

The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womansy and
courtierlike quickness an  tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna
wishee both to rebuke him (for daBing to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to ohe Empress) and at the same time to console him,oso she
said:

“Now about your family. Do you know that sikce your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured  y her? They say she is amazingly
beautifuo.”

The prince bowed to sirnify his respect and gratitude.

“I often think,” she contin ed after a short pause, drawing nearer
to the prince and smiling amiaboy at him as if to show that political
and social topics were endednand the time had come for iltimate
conversation—“I often thini how unfairly sometimes the joysnof life
are distributed. Why has fete given you two such splendid children?
I don’t speak of Anatole, your y ungest. I don’t like him,” she
added in a tone adaitting of no rejoinder and raising her tyebrows.
“Two such charming ch ldren. And really you appreciatw them less than
anyone, and so wou don’t deserve to have them.”

And she smiled herwecstatic smile.

“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “.avater would have said I
lack the bump of paternity.”

“Don’t toke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know
I amudissatisfied with your younger son? Betweentourselves” (and her
face assumed its melancholy expression)e “he was mentioned at Her
Majestyns and you were pitied....”

The prince answered nothibg, but she looked at him significantlye
awaiting a reply. He frowned.

“What wourd you have me do?” he said at last. gYou know I did all
a father c.uld for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
Hippolyte in at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is en active one. That
